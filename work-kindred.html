    <p>During my employment with <a href="workingmouse.com.au">WorkingMouse</a> I had the opportunity to work with
        Kindred a client in realestate.</p>
    <p>The client wanted to change the realestate workflow and to do so, it required a client portal.</p>
    <p>Alongside this client portal we also created the <a href="work-kindred-gz.html">Green Zone Portal</a>, which
        allows Kindred to communicate with clients promptly.</p>

    <section class="work-detail">
        <div class="work-img-wrapper">
            <img alt="Kindred client portal property enquiry" src="img/work/kindred-client-2.png" />
        </div>

        <section class="info">
            <p>This client portal for Kindred has been designed for Kindred's clients to view property and enquire about
                them dynamically.</p>
            <p>This client portal allowed for users to view properties and chat with a Kindred agent to further build
                their relationship with Kindred and accomplish their property goals.</p>

        </section>

        <div class="work-img-wrapper">

        <section class="info">
            <h6>The problem</h6>
            <p>Kindred wanted an innovative way for clients to contact them whenever they see fit to their own schedule
                and recieve a response right away.</p>
            <p>Our client saw a flaw in realestate and wanted to enhance their customers' experience by providing the
                best service.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="work-img-wrapper mobile">
            <img alt="Kindred client portal mobile views" src="img/work/kindred-client-4.png" />

        <section class="info">
            <h6>The solution</h6>
            <p>With the current problem Kindred is facing, we have spent hte time to undergo discovery interviews,
                brainstorming sessions and design solutions that were constnatly re-iterated after user testing.</p>
            <p>We finalised our findings by producing a web and mobile-focused system that allowed clients to view
                available properties and enquire about them immediately.</p>
            <p>Clients were able to create their profile, save their favourites and communicate with Kindred employees
                consistently to accomplish their property goals.</p>

    <p>Once we have prototyped, the developers started the frontend development and I customised the styling using <a
            href="work-harmony.html">Harmony's</a> Library. I styled using SCSS and with Harmony's pre-defined styles I
        was able to accomplish these customisations rapidly.</p>
