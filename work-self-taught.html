    <p>Self taught is an online app that helps students learn languages and log their progress with their studies.</p>
    <p>If assigned, teachers can view their student's progress and review their homework.</p>

            <p>My client had requested to redesign the application that he had built, he wanted it to be mobile
                responsive and more user friendly.</p>
            <p>Since my client wanted to focus on the students in this application, I had decided to redesign the
                application as a student user and focus on the experience of the application as a student.</p>

            <h6>The problem</h6>
            <p>The client wanted a redesign the application in a way to allow users to use the application on both
                mobile and web.</p>
            <p>They also wanted a better user experience and flow of the application on the web and a more mobile
                friendly experience when they're on mobile.</p>

        </div>

        <section class="info">
            <h6>The solution</h6>
            <p>I have decided to design the mobile experience of the application first and made sure to design the web
                after.</p>
            <p>I interviewed the students and their process into learning a new language and how they would have used
                the application, I found their pain points and made sure I tend to them.</p>
            <p>The application was then redesigned with a new UI and UX.</p>
